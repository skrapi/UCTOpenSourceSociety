# UCTOpenSourceSociety (temp name)

**Idea**: An organisation (loosely defined) which curates projects developed by UCT students and graduates. Any project which fits into an Engineering field or Computer Science field, can be added as long it has the correct documentation explaining what it is and what additions it needs.

**Aim**: To encourage the open sourcing of the various projects developed during a university career which often die as soon as the student leaves or gets bored. This would allow for better a better representation of what is being done at UCT, and allow for people to continue projects past their due dates.

**Benefits**:

* Create a digital community for UCT students and graduates.
* Expose students to more resources and inspiration.
* Could be used as method of attaining rep, CV building.
